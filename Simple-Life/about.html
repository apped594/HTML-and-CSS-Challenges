            <p>
                <span class="emphasise">I used to be a pack rat</span>. I had so many things that I thought that I loved, but the truth was I couldn't even appreciate any of it because there was too much.

                Things were terrible. I had a job that I hated, a home that I didn't want to live in, and I couldn't hold a relationship.

            </p>

            <h2 class="about-subtitle">How I turned things around</h2>

            <p>
                <span class="emphasise">I was on the verge of a breakdown when I got rid of everything</span>. 
                I literally put 90% of my possessions in the garbage, sold my place and moved into a smaller apartment, and I quit my job.

                It wasn't easy at all, but everything around me was in such a bad place, I didn't know what else to do. And it worked.

            </p>

            <h2 class="about-subtitle">Now I live the simple life</h2>

            <p>
                Now that I'm living a simple life, things are so much better. I'm less stressed, enjoy life and work more, and I have more free time to enjoy.

                With how much it turned my life around, <span class="emphasise">felt like I had no choice but to start sharing how I did it</span>, and how others can benefit from living a simple life as well, which is why I started this site!
